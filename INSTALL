REQUIREMENTS
============

You need the following packages on your system:

* cmake
* libpcap0.8-dev  (version >= 0.8 will definitely work)
* libnet1-dev     (version >= 1.1 will definitely work)
* libcli-dev      (version >= 1.9.1 will work)

BUILD PROCESS
=============

Then simply run

  cmake .

Don't forget the period in this command. This which will create a Makefile for
your system. Cmake allows you to specify optional variables here, for example
for another install location use cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path


Once this Makefile has been created, enter

  make
  
and the executable binary 'mz' should be available in the
'src' directory.


INSTALLATION
============

Finally install the binary automatically on the right place:

  make install
  
To specify another location see the comment above.


OTHER ISSUES
============

* Try out 'make help' to see all other targets.

* To use the view_rtp_avg.py program (to visualize jitter data) you must 
  install the matplotlib package for Python.
