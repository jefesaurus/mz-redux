The file example_lldp.conf contains an example list of commands to create a
bogus LLDP packet.

You can load this configuration from the Mausezahn command line, e. g. via:

mz-0.39# load /home/hh/tmp/example_lldp.conf

in case you copied the file in that path. Now when you enter 'show packet' you
will see a new packet entry in the packet list. Use the 'start slot <nr>'
command to activate this packet.

You can store your own packet creations in such file and easily load them when
you need them. Every command within such configuration files is executed on the
command line interface as if you had typed it in -- so be careful about the
order and don't forget to use 'configure terminal' as first command.

You can even load other files from within a central config file.
