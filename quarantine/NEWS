Dear Mausezahn users,

since version 0.38, Mausezahn supports a multi-threaded interactive mode with
a Cisco-style command line. 

Try e. g. "mz -x 99" and telnet to port 99. This mode utilizes a new protocol 
and packet management framework called MOPS (Mausezahn's Own Packet System).
All new features will be added to the MOPS which represents the new core
framework of Mausezahn. 

If you execute Mausezahn traditionally, specifying all packet parameters as
arguments on the LINUX/UN*X shell, then MOPS is NOT used (libnet instead).
MOPS on the other hand does not need libnet anymore but creates all PDUs
completely by itself. This allows for a much more flexible header treatment,
such as an arbitrary number of MPLS headers or intentionally 'wrong' header 
fields.

The most interesting new features introduced by MOPS are:

*) Nanosecond interpacket delay and overall transmission intervals (days, hours, ... )
*) New additional protocols: LLDP, IGMPv1 and IGMPv2, extended spanning tree
   options (for RSTP, MSTP, PVST+)
*) Valid or wrong checksums on multiple layers
*) RTP measurement compatibility with legacy and MOPS RTP mode
*) Access to *all* header fields, even to those "reserved" or "must be zero"
*) Very flexible and user friendly QoS options (ToS, DSCP, IPP, CoS, ...) in
   different notations (hex, dec, binary, "EF", "AF32", ...)
*) New 'launch' command to start often-used packet processes quickly (will be
   extended soon)
*) Each packet process can be tied to another physical interface
*) Each physical interface can be given an arbitrary fake MAC and/or IP address.
*) 802.1Q and MPLS tags with all parameters can be configured easily with the
   'tag' command.


You can store your packet configurations in text files and load them from the
Mausezahn command line interface.


*** PLEASE send be bug reports! ***

Next planned features: (among many others)

- IPv6 support for MOPS
- XML-based definitions of custom protocols
- Graphical user interface
- Logging service
- ICMP support for MOPS

and other...
